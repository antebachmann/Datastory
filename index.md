## Abstract

Two subjects are consistently banned at family gatherings, politics and religion. This is because ~~everyone else is wrong~~ many of us feel very strongly about those matters, generally because we are directly affected or have a lot of self-esteem riding on "being right".

As with anything so widely cared about, we generate an almost endless amount of political discourse, and everyone, no matter their qualifications, wants to express themselves. There is so much political discourse that we can often hear people commenting on the discourse itself rather than the politics it conveys, this is what we want to study here.


**How emotionally do we express our politics, and is it affected by our proximity to them?** Is the question we aim to answer.

## Methods

In our data story we focus on **how groups of people feel about certain issues**.

To test our hypothesis we use the [quotebank](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf) dataset, which we filter by issue, then we run sentiment analysis on every issue, keeping years separate, finally we use [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) to associate a person with each quote.

_In fine_, this allows us to observe sentiments by year, issue, and gender. Then we can observe whether the tone of discourse evolves over time, if specific groups have different attitudes, and what is the overall mood of one issue compared to another.

## Ugly markdown example

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/antebachmann/datastory/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/antebachmann/datastory/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
