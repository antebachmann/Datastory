# How do you think about it?

## Abstract

Two subjects are consistently banned at family gatherings, politics and religion. This is because ~~everyone else is wrong~~ many of us feel very strongly about those matters, generally because we are directly affected or have a lot of self-esteem riding on "being right".

As with anything so widely cared about, we generate an almost endless amount of political discourse, and everyone, no matter their qualifications, wants to express themselves. There is so much political discourse that we can often hear people commenting on the discourse itself rather than the politics it conveys, this is what we want to study here.


**How emotionally do we express our politics, and is it affected by our proximity to them?** Is the question we aim to answer.

## Methods

In our data story we focus on **how groups of people feel about certain issues**.

To test our hypothesis we use the [quotebank](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf) dataset, which we filter by issue, then we run sentiment analysis on every issue, keeping years separate, finally we use [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) to associate a person with each quote.

_In fine_, this allows us to observe sentiments by month, issue, country, gender, and religion. Then we can observe whether the tone of discourse evolves over time, if specific groups have different attitudes, and what is the overall mood of one issue compared to another. By splitting quotes into neutral, negative and positive we achieve an idea of discourse tone.

We selected four highly controversial topics in the english-speaking world:

### Abortion

Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. When steps are taken to achieve that effect, it is an induced abortion, but the word abortion generally refers to those procedures. Without intervention, it is generally known as miscarriage. The debate over the ethics of abortion is old, Aristotle makes ethical comments on the matter in 350BCE within his *[Politics](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D7%3Asection%3D1335b)* treatise. The discussion is likely to be as old as abortion itself, which dates back to at least early antiquity, but we lack sources on the debate at the time.

Since the middle of the twentieth century, most of the western world authorizes abortions in one fashion or another, in the united states the debate is still very much ongoing, with stances ranging from treating the procedure as a form of murder to keeping it as a right for all citizens while guaranteeing its easy and safe access. 

### Climate change

Climate change refers to the current warming of global temperatures caused by human activity. Scientifically, the matter is quite [cut](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/) and [dry](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/). It is happening, and if nothing is done to widely mitigate the changes it brings, the consequences will be dire. Politically, this is a different matter, where many deny the science openly, others minimize its impact, some offer little in the way of change, and others yet propose radical solutions. What must be done, which countries must do it, should anything be done at all, etc etc this is a complex issue with no political consensus.

The debate has been raging since the eighties, and is unlikely to wane as we start experiencing the consequences and urgency increases.

### Gender equality

This one hardly needs introducing, gender equality, in particular women's rights is a fight present worldwide through feminism. In the western world, especially including the united states and united kingdom, voting rights for women were secured in the first half of the twentieth century amongst a wealth of other individual rights. Despite this, equality [has yet to be achieved](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/talented-women-graduates-face-gender-inequality-in/) in many places. One current struggle in the US focuses on sexual harassment and violence against woman, exemplified by the Me Too movement.

### Gun control

Simply put, the united states of america allows most of its citizens to privately own firearms. Individual states and cities may further restrict said rights. Overall [one third of americans own guns](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/gun-ownership.html). The united states are famously the flagship of school shooting, having multiple times the incidence of entire continents. This is widely attributed to the easy access of guns within the country, as is the prevalence of gun crime.

This issue is extremely divisive in the context of the united states, as the right to bear arms is the second amendment of the united states constitution, the country's founding legal document.

## The tone of discourse

### Comparing issues

Is emotivity equal throughout the discourse, or is that dependant on subject? To answer this we look at sentiment by matter over our four chosen.


![Figure 1: sentiment by matter](https://github.com/antebachmann/datastory/blob/gh-pages/images/fig1.png)

We see that three issues are distributed quite negatively, and the fourth one is much more positive, this would indicate that the discourse is predominantly negative, especially as 


Looking at the distributions of the compound scores for the different four topics, we see that humans tend to not sit on the fence. They have strong opinions and are generally firm in their beliefs. On average across the four topics, only 16.4 % of the quotes are classified as neutral quotes. These quotes could have easily been facts stated by a journalist or an expert when discussing the topic. For example, in the following quote we have Peter Atkins a chemist stating that: 'Temperatures go up every year, so we got to try and mitigate that.' He is clearly stating a fact based on observations made by scientists. He is not defending the existence of climate change in this quote and is not using extremely emotive words. 

If we look more closely at each topic, we can study how people speak about their opinions. A negative score is attributed when a quote includes words with negative conotations, as opposed to a positive score. We observe that for certain topics people tend to use more words with more negative connotation as in gun control, while more positive sentiments are expressed while talking about global warming or abortion. As for gender inequality, it seems to be relatively close. 

We next study the sentiments of the issues over time. We look at how strongly people's opinions are over the months and years. Clearly during certain months there is more passionate talk about an issue. This could be caused by some event. For instance, after mass shootings occur, more people are likely to talk about gun control in a nonchalant manner. On the 12th of June 2016, a mass shooting occurred in Orlando Florida. This clearly sparked the conversation about gun control. 

When looking at the different attributes versus the topics, we first see that different groups tend to be more interested in different topics. For instance, gun control is a huge topic in the US as opposed to Germany. While global warming is more talked about in Hindu communities versus atheists.
